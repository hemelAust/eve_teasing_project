			<p class="font">Eve teasing has bearing very serious situation in Bangladesh. Village or urban area nothing got escaped from eve teasing. Even couldn't our village, I am Arman Ahmed Hemel. I am a dweller of Chutia village in Chuadanga. As a man, I am ashamed of this dirty work of man race. But this problem of our village as carrying serious situation, so, it couldn't being sit by us. So , I decided to take some actions with my friend Biswajit Pande to fix this problem.</p>
 
			<h2 class="font">Reasons Behind Spread of Eve Teasing</h2>
			<p class="font">Eve teasing increases unhealthily when many women go to school or work place besides men. It is very natural with the growth of women education; women will go to work place for being financially self dependent. However some men's blind reformation, closed mind cannot accept it.  As the mind and eyes are accustomed to seeing women as householders, that mind and eyes cannot accept women to stand with their own pride and dignity.
Eve teasing is a crime and who does it they have to get severe punishment, despite knowing this sometimes women do not complain for the fear of social criticism. Thousands of years covered with darkness, male dominated society makes women responsible for this wrong doing which occurs with them. So , most of the time it remains without any justice. And thus this crime increases slowly and demonstrates enormously.
</p>

			<h2 class="font">Reasons Behind Eve Teasing</h2>
			<p class="font">taking some actions we observed that eve teasers are our friends or our brothers, without them we cannot imagine our society so, by eliminating them we cannot expect to build a beautiful society. So, what we will do, will have to do with them. We have to create awareness among all, that is how big crime the eve teasing is going to give a barrier. First of all what we did is that younger and elder brothers from neighborhood, whom are being seem doing eve teasing often, we discussed frankly and in a friendly way with them.
After the discussion we have identified the reasons and they are as follows:

			<ul>
				<li class="font">* The erosion of social, cultural, moral values and families </li> 
				<li class="font">* The lack of respect aspect</li>
				<li class="font">* Lack of leisure time spent for recreation. For example: The lack of sport field.</li>
				<li class="font">* Product and material is women.</li>
				<li class="font">* The lack of healthy cultural studies.</li>
				<li class="font"><p>* Lack of awareness of parents about the environment where their children grows.  According to them there is no need too much care about boy child but it is necessary to worry about a girl child to keep them in home.</p>
Here the problems that we have identified, according to us those should be the only aspect of an illiterate people. But with the hardships we discovered that so called educated men's mentality is same.
