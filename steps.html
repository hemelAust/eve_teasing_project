			<h2 class="font">Steps To Prevent Eve Teasing</h2>
	        <p class="font">So, for eliminating the eve teasing we have to take specific steps very slowly. Steps are as follows:
	        <h3 class="font">*co-operation of dominant environment-</h3>
		    <p class="font">We gather more similar boys and girls and like an organization we together meet with our union council chairman. We requested him to give the appropriate punishment against eve teasing in our area. He agreed with us and reassured us that without finding victim's fault eve teasers will be punished for that.</p>
	        <h3 class="font">*Printing leaflet and posters-</h3>
		    <p class="font">Our union council chairman gave us some money and with the help of that we printed leaflet and posters about the awareness which includes that eve teasing is a punishable crime.</p>
			<p class="font">The leaflet and poster's statements are as follows:</p>
			<p class="font">Eve teasing is a punishable crime. There is law of punishment. So, only just for pleasure do not bring suffering for yourselves and your family.
			</p>

	        <h3 class="font">Existing Laws against Eve Teasing in Bangladesh</h3>
	        <p class="font">There is some law related to eve teasing in our country. They are:</p>

	           </tr>


	        </table>
	        <h3 class="font">Leagal Actions of Bangladesh</h3>
	        <p class="font">All nation are afraid and government is embarrassed for the awful spread of eve teasing all over the country. With the goal of the safe life of women and to prevent and eradicate the eve teasing which have turned into social terrorism, recently there has been taken some legal steps.
				For Example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="font">*Mobile court:</li> 	
				<p class="font">With the judicial power of mobile court added under panel code section 509 to stop the eve teasing.  This is effective from 9th November 2010. With this court eve teasers are brought under immediate punishment. In this section magistrate can judge one year imprisonment or fine or both in the spot to eve teaser.</p>
				<li class="font">*Complaint number 7373:</li>
				<p class="font">Bangladesh police has launched complaint 7373 by which women can complain with a phone call.</p>
				<li class="font">*Prevention Committee:</li>
				<p class="font">Every educational institution has been instructed to build eve teasing prevention committee by Ministry of Education. The prevention committees are now alive in every educational institution of our area.</p>
				<li class="font">*Prevention of sexual harassment Act in educational institution and workplace 2010:</li>
				<p class="font">In this law the serious and minor both punishments are included.</p>
	  
		
			</ul>
			<h2 class="font">Remedy and Resistance:</h2>
			<p class="font">Let's fight against the social disease that named eve teasing. Let's demand for the punishment for wrong doing instead of being afraid. And it is a request for all parents that keep every information about your son and make your daughter brave.</p>
				<p class="font">Leaving unauthorized practice of changing others clothing let's change our mentality and build an eve teasing free Bangladesh.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="font">*Adequate opportunity to play sports and games:</li>
				<p class="font">The boys of our area get interest for eve teasing because they could not do anything in their leisure time. So, we built a sports organization in our area. This organization organizes various sports in various times. For this the interest of eve teasing decreased slowly. Eve teasers are the part of our society and we have to bring them into the right path.</p>
				<li class="font">*Make women aware:</li>
				<p class="font">Women are not responsible for eve teasing. They don't have to be afraid for this wrong doing. They have to protest against wrong doing. In this regard there a committee has reformed with some girls in our area. This committee is continuing the work to aware women.</p>
					<p class="font">Now-a-days the situation of eve teasing in our village is lot better. And several times eve teasers got appropriate punishment for this kind of act. One day Bangladesh will become eve teasing free country. We are moving ahead with this dream.  </p>
